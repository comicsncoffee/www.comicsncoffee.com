In July we held a giveaway for a copy of Avengers: Infinity War on Blu-ray and we're happy to announce the winner of that giveaway.
Congratulations to **Christine Weary** from **Newport, Pennsylvania** on winning the Blu-ray for one of the biggest movies in 2018!

If you didn't win, no worries.
Stay tuned for more giveaways in the future.
We're planning on giving away more blu-rays, movie tickets, t-shirts, and more.


## Introducing Comics 'N' Coffee Meetups

From the start, the plan for Comics 'N' Coffee was always to bring together Marvel and DC fans to form a fun, safe, and rewarding community.
We've started down this path, online at least, by communicating with people on social media, building and growing [our website](https://www.ComicsNCoffee.com), and of course with [the podcast](https://www.comicsncoffee.com/podcast).
We're now getting the pieces together to bring comic book fans together in real life with meetup groups.

CnC meetups will be simple and fun.
We're looking to do things such as small meet and greets at coffee shops, movie and trivia nights, group discussions on the latest comic book issues, and more.

### Comics 'N' Coffee NYC

We're happy to announce the formation of our first meetup group, [Comics 'N' Coffee NYC](https://www.meetup.com/Comics-N-Coffee-NYC/).
If you live in or near New York City, we'd love for you to join our meetup group.
Our first meetup will be later this month (August) and we're aiming to host 1 or 2 meetups a month.
[Join Us](https://www.meetup.com/Comics-N-Coffee-NYC/).

### Don't Live Near NYC?

As we start and grow the NYC meetup, we're already looking for more cities.
Should we start a meetup group in your city? Please respond to this email, contact us [on the website](https://www.comicsncoffee.com/contact), or message us on social media (see email footer) and let us know where you live and why we should start our next meetup group there.
